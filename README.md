yanker
===========

Model-agnostic framework to parse type-theoretic grammars and derive representation of sentences in
abstract models of meaning.

In Haskell.

It can be installed from the repository:
```
git clone http://github.com/wetneb/yanker
cd yanker
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install
```
Then, assuming that the place where `cabal` stores its binaries in in your path, running `yanker` starts the editor.

If you use Ubuntu or Debian, you can also use one of the following packages:
 * http://antonin.delpeuch.eu/yanker/haskell-yanker_0.1.0.1_amd64.deb
 * http://antonin.delpeuch.eu/yanker/haskell-yanker_0.1.0.1_i386.deb
